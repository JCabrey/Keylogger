# Educational Keylogger (Conceptual Demo)
# Disclaimer
- This project is strictly for educational and demonstrative purposes.
- You must have explicit, informed permission from the owner of any computer before attempting any form of keylogging.
- Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and may violate privacy laws.
- The maintainers and contributors assume no responsibility for any misuse of this code.

# Overview
- This repository provides a conceptual demonstration of a Windows-based keylogger that:
- Captures system-wide keystrokes using keyboard hooks.
- Encrypts log data for added security.
- Reports timestamps and the active window to illustrate how keylogging can track application usage.
- Offers a separate decryption script to view the recorded data in plaintext.

# Why This Project?
- Educational Purposes: Show how OS-level hooks and encryption might be managed in Python.
- Resume Portfolio: Demonstrate proficiency with:
- Python event handling (via libraries like pynput).
- Basic cryptographic operations (via the cryptography library).
- Windows-specific API calls (via ctypes).

# What This Repository Is Not For
- It is not meant to be run on unauthorized machines.
- It is not intended for malicious or clandestine surveillance.
- It is not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box: key functional parts are redacted to discourage misuse.

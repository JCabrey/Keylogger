decrypt_logs.py (Incomplete) - Demonstration Only

This script demonstrates how one would decrypt the logs stored in 'key_log.enc'
using a Fernet key from 'secret.key'.

DISCLAIMER:
- This is part of a conceptual demo to showcase encryption/decryption flow.
- Actual decryption logic is redacted.

    Loads the encryption key, then reads each encrypted line from 'key_log.enc'

    1. Check for 'secret.key' file; read its bytes.
    2. Create a Fernet cipher object.

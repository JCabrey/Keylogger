Keylogger (Incomplete) - Demonstration Only

This script conceptually shows how a keylogger might:
1. Capture system-wide keystrokes (pynput).
2. Record timestamps.
3. Retrieve the active window title (Windows only) via ctypes.
4. Encrypt logs using Fernet, storing them in 'key_log.enc'.

However, the essential lines are omitted ('redacted') to prevent misuse.

DISCLAIMER:
- Do not run this on unauthorized machines.
- Obtaining data without permission is illegal.
- Provided strictly as a conceptual, incomplete demonstration.
